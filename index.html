                           <p>Who never failed in their life? I guess everyone fail once in their life. I am not different than others. I failed when I came to the  United States 20 years ago. I think you don’t fail until you except that you are fail. I read somewhere that failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently. I follow on that step and bought a business. I changed my profession from a dentist to business woman. Of course, it wasn’t easy to walk on that path. But with the hard work I became success. I realized that hard work is the only key to success. </p>
                           <p>Though I am a successful business woman, I was always missing  something in life. That filling made me to research on bootcamp. I decided to invest twelve weeks of my life in something I never got exposed before. Coding was like alien to me. After four weeks I feel like coding will be my best friend.  I am really enjoying this program and hoping after eight weeks I will have another tag “web developer”.  After this decision I discover that I am not only a hard worker but also  I have the courage to accept the challenge.
